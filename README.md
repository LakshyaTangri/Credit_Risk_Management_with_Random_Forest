# Credit Risk Management with Random Forest

A machine learning model to assess the risk of bank loan applications using the Random Forest algorithm. This project aims to help financial institutions automate and enhance their loan approval processes by identifying potentially risky applications with high accuracy.

## 📊 Project Overview

* **Objective**: Predict the likelihood of a loan default based on applicant features.
* **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier
* **Dataset**: [UCI Credit Approval Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) *(or mention your specific source if different)*
* **Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
